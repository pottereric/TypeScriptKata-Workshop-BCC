# Typescript Kata Workshop

## Initialization
1. Start by cloning the repository 
2. Navigate to the new folder in terminal and run <code>npm install</code>

## How to participate
First start by cloning the repository using either SSH or HTTPS<br>
If you've already cloned the repository, follow the below instructions to participate:
1. Navigate to the <code>main</code> branch
2. Pull down the latest changes
3. Create a new branch named with your initials.
4. Navigate to the prompt you want to solve and open the <code>.ts</code> file associated with it
5. Add a solution to the empty function declared inside of the <code>.ts</code> file
6. Once you are finished, set the constant <code>READY_TO_TEST</code> to be <code>true</code> instead of <code>false</code>
7. Run <code>npm test</code> to test your solution
    - If your solution doesn't pass but you want to work on a different prompt, just set <code>READY_TO_TEST</code> back to <code>false</code>
8. When you are finished, add/commit/push your changes to your branch for the world to see :)
